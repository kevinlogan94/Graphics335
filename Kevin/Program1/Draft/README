Program/Homework 1

Description: In this assignment I implemented a simple 2D drawing program 
with OpenGL. This contains 2 shapes, one defined in the template code and the
other is a circle. 
Circle is interactive:
 Horizontally - A/F
 Vertically - Z/W
 Radius - O/P
 
 Files Included:
 	README - This file
 	Main.java - File containing the main function and program setup.
 	JogleEventListener.java - Contains code for keylistener, eventlistener, 
 							  and shapes drawn.
